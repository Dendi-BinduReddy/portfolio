        <ul>
            <li>Restaurant website</li>
            <p>Making a layout for a restaurant will be a bit complicated than previous project examples. You will be aligning the different food items and drinks using a CSS layout grid. You will be adding prices, images and you need to give it a beautiful look and feel as well using the proper combination of colors, font-style and images. You can add pictures gallery for different food items, you can also add sliding images for a better look</p>
            <li>Event or Conference web page</li>
            <p>You can make a static page holding an event or conference. People who are interested in attending the conference create a register button for them. Mention different links for speaker, venue and schedule at the top in the header section. Describe the purpose of the conference or the category of people who can get benefit from this conference. Add an introduction and images of the speaker, venue detail and the main purpose of the conference on your webpage. Divide the page into sections, add header and footer showcasing the menu. </p>
            <li>Music Store Page</li>
            <p>Add a suitable background image describing the purpose or what the page is all about. In the header section add different menus. Add buttons, links, images and some description about the collection of songs available. At the bottom mention the links for shopping, store, career or contact details. You can also add other features on your webpages such as a trial option, gift cards or subscription.</p>
